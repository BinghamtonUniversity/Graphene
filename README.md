## This Project has been Abandoned.

myBinghamton (this code) was originally written by the Binghamton University ITS 'Innovations Team' in 2014-2015.    
In July of 2018, Binghamton University switched Binghamton Univeristy's campus portal ([myBinghamton](https://my.binghamton.edu)) to [Graphene](https://github.com/EscherLabs/Graphene/), an open source "User Experience Platform" based on a superior technology stack, and free from Binghamton University specific code and branding.  While the code contained within this project is fully functional and available for use, the original authors are no longer developing or supporting this codebase. 

If you are interested in creating a "portal" with the same codebase as Binghamton University's [myBinghamton](https://my.binghamton.edu), please see Graphene (https://github.com/EscherLabs/Graphene/)
